    <title>Css Grid VS Flexbox</title>
</head>
<body>
    <H2>When to Use Flexbox:</H2>
    <p>Flexbox is suitable when you have a one-dimensional layout (either rows or columns).
        If your table structure is simple and you don't need a grid with both rows and columns, Flexbox can be a lightweight solution.
        When the content within cells has varying sizes and you want them to adjust dynamically.</p>

        <h2>When to Use Grid:</h2>
        <p>Use CSS Grid when you need a two-dimensional layout (rows and columns).
            If you require precise control over the placement of cells in both directions.
            For complex tables with varying row and column sizes.</p>

            <h2>Summary:</h2>

            <p>In the context of an HTML table, the choice between Flexbox and Grid depends on the complexity of your table structure and the level of control you need over the layout. For more table-like structures with a consistent grid, CSS Grid might be more appropriate. If you have a simpler structure or need items to flow in a single direction, Flexbox can be a more lightweight solution.</p>
